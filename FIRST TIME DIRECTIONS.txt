	Welcome to the Game of Thrones vocal recognition quiz. The concept was to devise a game utilizing the audio file playback capabilities in Csound, as well as a synthesizer. 
	Once compiled and ran, program opens with a welcome screen accompanied by the CsoundSynthesizer playing the chord tones of an A minor chord sequentially, then simultaneously.
	The game has one menu in which the player is prompted to choose one of 9 kingdoms. Each kingdom has one multiple choice question to answer after playing a short recording of a character from that kingdom. If the user answers correctly, a message is printed on the console informing the user of their correct answer and immediately asks the user to play again. If the answer is incorrect, a message informs the user of this and also asks the user to play again. If yes is selected, the game repeats, otherwise the game ends.
